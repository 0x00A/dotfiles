# dotfiles

## Synopsis
A collection of convenient configuration files and scripts. Inspired and pilfered from many people.

## Motivation
Machine configuration is tedious. There are lots of subtle tweaks and system changes that reside in various places. The process for integrating these changes can be time consuming.

## Installation
Don't use this repo `as-is`. These are personalized files, you should know and understand the scripts before you run them. Once you've done that,
simply run the `bootstrap.sh` script and it will copy the files from the cloned repo into your `home` directory.

```bash

  ./bootstrap.sh

```
